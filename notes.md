# notes from tutorial 
## part 1

Most of this was how to set up the storyboard. Use groups _which_ seem to be like a toned down version to stack views. Then added
in links to the labels and configured the view controller. This is a special version for Watch. You also need to install upfront 
a template watch UI target (toolkit) from File > New > Target which is not the same as File > New > File.

## part 2

Was about setting up table cells (said to be simplier than elsewhere in iOS) and linking everything together. There are no delegates apparently. Nice trick for linking the UI to the classes: if you right click on the tree in the document view it gives you a selection of labels you can drag across. Their design also has a set label handler which makes good sense.
